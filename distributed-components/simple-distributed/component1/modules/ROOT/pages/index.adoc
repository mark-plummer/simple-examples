== A simple distributed component

This is a simple example of a distributed component.

* One content file is in component1 and one in component2.
* One navigation file is in component1 and one in component2.
* All the configuration for the component is in component1's `antora.yml`.
* Antora errors if you have duplicated a navigation or content file across the multiple sources for the component.
* Note the component selector (below the nav tree) has only one component listed.
* The content is one component because the two `antora.yml` files have the same name and version attributes. 

Here's a link to the content in the other part:
