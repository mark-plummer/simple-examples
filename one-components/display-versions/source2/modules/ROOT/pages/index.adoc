== A home page

* In source tree at {page-origin-start-path} (referenced from antora-playbook.yml sources)
* Actual version (for sorting): {page-component-version}
* Display version: {page-component-display-version}

Note that master is handled differently from other versions:

* It is always sorted at the top
* The content is directly at the component name, rather than under the version, in the generated site.
