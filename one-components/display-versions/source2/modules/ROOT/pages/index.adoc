= Display Versions Single Component

== A home page

* In source tree at source2 (referenced from antora-playbook.yml sources)
* Actual version (for sorting): master
* Display version: display B (master)

Note that master is handled differently from other versions:

* It is always sorted at the top
* The content is directly at the component name, rather than under the version, in the generated site.
