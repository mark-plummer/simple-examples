= Including pages with stem content
:stem:
:a: a
:b: b
:sqroot: sqrt
:expr: sqrt(9) = 3
:x: x
:y: y
:frac: \frac
:expr: v=\frac{{x}}{x^2+y^2}

== Limitations

* The top level including page must include the '`:stem:`' declaration and all attribute definitions used.
* To avoid interference between formats, either use only one format or use the explicit block and macro format names.
* Since the attribute definitions must all be repeated on the including page, collisions may occur.
For instance here, there are two definitions of '`expr`', and the second one is used in the asciimath attribute substitution example.
This inadvertently shows that asciimath can properly interpret some latexmath, however relying on this is apt to produce unexpected results.
