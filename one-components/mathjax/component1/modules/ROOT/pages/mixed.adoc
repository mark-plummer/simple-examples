== Configuration

* The `:stem:` attribute in the document header specifies latexmath.
* In these examples, use of asciimath or latexmath is signaled using the explicit '`asciimath`' or '`latexmath`' block and macro name notation.
This explicit specification will always work, even through included pages.
Relying on different document attribute values may not work with inclusions.

== Asciimath Examples

=== Asciimath block

A matrix followed by some square roots can be written as 

[asciimath]
++++
[[a,b],[c,d]]((n),(k))
sqrt(4) = 2
sqrt(9) = 3
++++

=== Inline in a paragraph

Some text might suddenly need to show some matrix calculations, such as asciimath:[[[a,b\],[c,d\]\]((n),(k))].

=== Inline, using attribute substitution

If you are not interested in exciting formulae such as asciimath:a[[[{a},{b}\],[c,d\]\]((n),(k))], perhaps you would find the more mundane asciimath:a[{sqroot}(4) = 2] or even asciimath:a[{expr1}] more to your taste.

=== Lists


* A matrix can be written as asciimath:[[[a,b\],[c,d\]\]((n),(k))].
** A square root looks like asciimath:[sqrt(4) = 2]
* Another square root looks like asciimath:[sqrt(9) = 3]

== Latexmath Examples

=== Latexmath block

Some vector components are

[latexmath]
++++
u=\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}\,,\quad
v=\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\,,\quad\text{and}\quad
w=0\,.
++++

=== Inline in a paragraph

Some text might suddenly need to show an integral written as latexmath:[\iint xy^2\,dx\,dy ].
A fraction looks like latexmath:[u=\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}].
Another fraction looks like latexmath:[v=\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}].


=== Inline, using attribute substitution

If you are not interested in exciting formulae such as latexmath:a[\iint {x}{y}^2\,dx\,dy ], perhaps you would find the more mundane latexmath:a[u={frac}{-y}{x^2+y^2}] or even latexmath:a[{expr2}] more to your taste.

=== Lists


* An integral can be written as latexmath:[\iint xy^2\,dx\,dy].
** A fraction looks like latexmath:[u=\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}].
* Another fraction looks like latexmath:[v=\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}].
