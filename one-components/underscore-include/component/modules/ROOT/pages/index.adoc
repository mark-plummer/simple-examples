= Index.adoc page for Underscore Include example

== This is rendered from index.adoc

This includes _underscore.adoc in a page already with content:

----
\include::_underscore.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
----

include::_underscore.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The leveloffset is necessary when including a standalone page to avoid an asciidoctor error and peculiar rendering.

== Inclusion of a partial page without level 0 title:

----
\include::_partial.adoc[]
----

include::_partial.adoc[]

== Link to page that is only inclusion:

xref:includeunderscore.adoc[xref:includeunderscore.adoc]
