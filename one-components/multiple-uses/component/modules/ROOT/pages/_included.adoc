= Included page

Note what happens to the nav tree depending on which flow this is selected from.

Here are links to the inclusion stubs:

== These always open the nav tree to the expected working flow:

xref::stub1.adoc[xref::stub1.adoc]

xref::stub2.adoc[xref::stub2.adoc]

== There is no way for Antora to decide if this should open broken flow 1 or flow 2:

xref::stub3.adoc[xref::stub3.adoc]
