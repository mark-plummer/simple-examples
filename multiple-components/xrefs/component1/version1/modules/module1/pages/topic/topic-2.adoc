== Page Coordinates

page-component-name: {page-component-name}

page-component-version: {page-component-version}

page-module: {page-module}

page-relative: {page-relative}

== Return link

xref:v1@component1::index.adoc#_2_specifying_only_module[v1@component1::index.adoc#_2_specifying_only_module]

Experimental links: a demonstration of link:https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/issues/575[ref::relative.adoc[\] syntax has unexpected meaning.]

Both these links lead to the index page in this module.
There is some expectation that the double-colon form should lead to the ROOT module.
However, the ambiguity might lead one to conclude that disallowing this unique double-colon form is best.
