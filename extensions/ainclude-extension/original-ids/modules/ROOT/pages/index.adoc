= `original_ids` option

In the treatise, each page has an `Abstract` section.
With the `original_ids` option, this results naively in duplicate generated ids.
Asciidoctor resolves that by adding a suffix to make the ids unique.
As a result, there's no way to predict how to link into the assembled document.

Links into the treatise `Abstract` sections.
