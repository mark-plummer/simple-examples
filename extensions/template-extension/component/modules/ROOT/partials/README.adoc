= Asciidoctor.js capturing templates
//tag::intro[]
:version: 0.0.2

WARNING: The `blockTemplate` processor from version `0.0.1` has been renamed more accurately `blockMacroTemplate` and a new `blockTemplate` processor added.

`@djencks/asciidoctor-template` provides an Asciidoctor.js extension to "capture" asciidoc templates, with "variable" parameters, and register block or inline macro templates to reproduce the content, with provided parameter values.
The parameter values are isolated from the outside document.

== Installation

Available through npm as `@djencks/asciidoctor-template`.

The project git repository is: https://gitlab.com/djencks/asciidoctor-template
//end::intro[]
== Usage in Asciidoctor.js

I am not a standalone Asciidoctor.js expert, so I will only quote one of the tests:

[source,js]
----
const templateProcessor = require('@djencks/asciidoctor-template')
const asciidoctor = require('@asciidoctor/core')()

const registry = templateProcessor.register(asciidoctor.Extensions.create())
const html = asciidoctor.convert(`
:var1: value of var1

[blockMacroTemplate,test,'var1,var2']
This is var1: {var1}.
This is var2: {var2}.

:var2: value of var2

test::[foo,bar]

== section {var1}

var1: {var1}

== section {var2}

var2: {var2}
`, { extension_registry: registry })

console.log(html)

//tag::installation[]
== Usage in Antora

Install this extension so it is visible to Antora.

=== Global installation

This is most useful if your project is not developed by a lot of people who need automated setup.

Run `npm i -g @djencks/asciidoctor-template`.
This will fetch and install the extension usable in all your Antora projects.

=== Local installation

This provides automated setup for your project from a git clone, all your users have to do is run `npm i`.
However, while it provides more precise version control of your dependencies, it adds a node_modules directory in your playbook project.

Add a package.json file for your Antora project, next to the playbook.
Here's an example:

[source,json,subs="+attributes"]
----
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "antora antora-playbook.yml --fetch --stacktrace"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@djencks/asciidoctor-template": "^{version}"
  }
}
----

The script is unnecessary but convenient.
You can also list the antora cli and site-generator-default in devDependencies and use this to install Antora.

* Run `npm i` to install this extension
** With the above, run `npm run build` to run Antora to build your site.

=== Add the extension to the playbook

* List the extension in the antora playbook:
----
asciidoc:
  extensions:
  - '@djencks/asciidoctor-template'
----
//end::installation[]

//tag::usage[]
== Configuration and Usage

This extension provides three block processors, `blockMacroTemplate`, `blockTemplate`, and `inlineTemplate`.
They are configured identically, with a name and list of positional parameters.
The following block becomes the template.
The processor registers either a block macro, a block, or inline macro under the provided name, with the specified positional parameters.

For instance:

[source,adoc]
--
[blockMacroTemplate,section,'subject,importance']
----
== Section dealing with {subject}

The subject of {subject} is of {importance} importance.
----
--

To use this template:

[source,adoc]
----

section::[earnestness,dramatic]

----

The `inlineTemplate` block processor is used similarly, except as the registered processor is an inline macro the calling syntax only has one colon.

The usage of the block processor registered from `blockTemplate` is different.
There is a special automatic named attribute, `content`, whose value is taken from the block following the processor use.
This allows easily using a large section of text as an attribute.
For instance, this shows the source for a kroki diagram, followed by the diagram:

[source,adoc]
....
[blockTemplate,sample]
----
'''

.Source
[source,adoc]
--
{content}
--

{content}

'''
----
....

This might be used:

[source,adoc]
....
[sample]
--
.As png
[plantuml,target=ab-embedded-2,format=png]
----
alice -> bob
bob -> alice
----
--
....


=== Semantics of parameters and scoping

Inside the template, parameters are referenced using attribute syntax `\{attribute-name}`, as seen above.
The value for the parameter comes from one of three places:

. A positional parameter named in the template block configuration.
Such a positional parameter must be configured in the block or inline macro use; "ambient" values from document attributes will be ignored.
However, the parameter may be set either in the appropriate position or as a named parameter.
. A named parameter specified in the block or inline macro use, after the slots for positional parameters.
For example, `section::[lightheartedess,,importance=serious]`.
. Other attributes defined in the document may be used in the template.
They will have the value as of the block or inline macro use.

Values supplied as positional or named parameters, and attributes defined inside the template, are scoped to the template use and are not visible elsewhere in the document.

=== Tables

A block template may include a table, but is processed partially as a nested table.
Although the table delimiter `|===` is used, the default cell delimiter is `!`.
To use the normal `|` cell delimiter, include `separator=|` in the table declaration, e.g. `[cols='3,2,5',separator=|]`.
